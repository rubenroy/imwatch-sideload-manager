The I'm Watch Android smart watch (www.imwatch.it) allows the installation of third party applications only over a proprietary cloud market service.

This simple application allows to directly install APKs into the system that are stored on the local storage in the watch. It presents the user with a directory listing and lets the user chooser the APK file to install.

Since also the application removal/de-install is orignally handled through the cloud service (we remember the famous Amazon Kindle remote de-install of bought content :) this application also contains a button to call the Android ApplicationManager intent so that the user can manage and eventually manually de-install applications again.
